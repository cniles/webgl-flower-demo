WebGLTK
-------

This is a WebGL game development toolkit in the making.  It will provide the
following functionality to facilitate game development using WebGL:

-Core game loop & timing
-Easy GL shader definition/loading/activation
-Game asset loading

Who knows where it's going to go.  Right now, it's just a framework for
creation of my own games.
